# 326 Final Project
Date: November 20, 2022

Overview of the project
A managing contact information script. I propose this script because it is hard to keep track of overflowing contacts.
The user will be able to view all the saved contact information as an organized form. 
Users are able to adjust contact information by adding new and deleting exisitng contact information
